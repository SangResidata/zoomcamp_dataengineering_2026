## Workflow Orchestration  

Welcome to Module 2 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp! This week, we’ll dive into workflow orchestration using Kestra.  
Kestra is an open-source, event-driven orchestration platform that simplifies building both scheduled and event-driven workflows. By adopting Infrastructure as Code practices for data and process orchestration, Kestra enables you to build reliable workflows with just a few lines of YAML.

## 2.1 - Introduction to Workflow Orchestration
In this section, you'll learn how to install Kestra, as well as the key concepts required to build your first workflow. Once our first workflow is built, we can extend this further by executing a Python script inside of a workflow.

### 2.1.1 What is Workflow Orchestration
Think of a music orchestra. There's a variety of different instruments. Some more than others, all with different roles when it comes to playing music. To make sure they all come together at the right time, they follow a conductor who helps the orchestra to play together.

Now replace the instruments with tools and the conductor with an orchestrator. We often have multiple tools and platforms that we need to work together. Sometimes on a routine schedule, other times based on events that happen. That's where the orchestrator comes in to help all of these tools work together.

A workflow orchestrator might do the following tasks:

    - Run workflows which contain a number of predefined steps
    - Monitor and log errors, as well as taking a number of extra steps when they occur
    - Automatically run workflows based on schedules and events

In data engineering, you often need to move data from one place, to another, sometimes with some modifications made to the data in the middle. This is where a workflow orchestrator can help out by managing these steps, while giving us visibility into it at the same time.

In this module, we're going to build our own data pipeline using ETL (Extract, Transform Load) with Kestra at the core of the operation, but first we need to understand a bit more about how Kestra works before we can get building!
You will:  

    1. Install Kestra using Docker Compose
    2. Learn the concepts of Kestra to build your first workflow
    3. Execute a Python script inside of a Kestra Flow  


### 2.1.2 What is Kestra?
Kestra is an open-source, infinitely-scalable orchestration platform that enables all engineers to manage business-critical workflows.

Kestra is a great choice for workflow orchestration:

    Build with Flow code (YAML), No-code or with the AI Copilot - flexibility in how you build your workflows
    1000+ Plugins - integrate with all the tools you use
    Support for any programming language - pick the right tool for the job
    Schedule or Event Based Triggers - have your workflows respond to data
